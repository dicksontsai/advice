## Issues (in no particular order)
<a name="perfectionism"></a>
### [perfectionism] Perfectionism ###
* People don’t like to get things wrong
* Problems:
  - Fixating too much on improving the results with quick gains (non-optimal greedy approach) instead of understanding the core issues. 
  - Obsessing over unimportant parts of your project.
* Solution: 
  - Slow down. You can get more things right by going slower.
  - Examine every single step of your project. Do not skip, or else you risk making mistakes.
  - Don’t patch bugs quickly (hoping to get things right immediately) without breaking down the problem

### [lackConf] Lack of Self-Confidence ###
* Got too many things wrong. Not sure if what you're doing is right.
* Problems:
  - You're less likely to exercise creativity, because every idea gets shot down with doubt.
  - You can't think logically, because you're not sure of the transitions.
* Solution:
  - Break things down as much as possible until you’re totally confident about it based on definitions/principles/etc.
  - Read how other people solve problems. How do they get from point A to point B? Logical thinking exists in math, CS, lit crit, etc.
  - Partner with a mentor/peer. Reinforce good thinking. Re-build faulty thinking. Eliminates the "self-deprecation" cycle from low self-confidence.

### [fallingBehind] Fear of Falling Behind ###
* “I don’t understand this, but I have to get through this"
* Your foundation is incomplete. See "Futon Effect".
* Solution: Slow starts can lead to faster growth over time. You just have to learn to trust this. Don't think like a greedy algorithm.
* Technical Note: think of your studying-time graph as having a cheap positive edge vs. expensive positive edge+big negative edge. Would you still run Dijkstra's to find the shortest path?

4. Boredom
* There's nothing "new" to learn: too stale, too easy, too difficult, too abstract, too irrelevant, ...
* Too stale: Look at the same content with an eye for new observations (new connections, new thought processes, etc.). Incorporate your new prior knowledge.
  * Example: My second pass of *La casa de Bernarda Alba* (in college) was richer than the first (in HS) because 1) I practiced reading Spanish lit more in college and 2) I read more lit crit concurrently.
* Too hard: Slow things down. Make it easier for yourself by simplifying the problem, isolating concepts, introducing supplementary material
* Too easy: Make broader generalizations. Apply concepts to a specific domain. Rigorously evaluate your understanding. (See how all of this is similar to research!)

### [laziness] Laziness ###
* Unwillingness to do target activity without significant willpower
* Exercise willpower is costly. Either spend more, or cut down on using willpower.
* Solution:
  - You shouldn’t see “breaking things down” as work. See it as something fun, empowering, a hobby, a musical instrument, etc. Not work. 
  - Don't do things in rigid increments (e.g. read a section of a textbook every day). Rigidity seems like a job requirement, not fun.

### [todo] Long To-Do List ###
* Can be overwhelming. Your mind is now occupied with multiple things. Everything gets done more slowly.
* Solution:
  - Use a multi-level queue. Your first queue is 3-5 top priorities. All other to-dos are placed in lower queue that you look at less periodically.
  - Look for places to be more time/energy efficient, but don’t rush. e.g. summarize sections instead of copying notes word-for-word
  - Don’t be intimidated. Just do things one-by-one.

### [anxiety] Anxiety ###
* Fears: Deadlines, exams, falling behind, not doing well relative to other people, ...
* Compounding effects, adverse health effects, lower quality work
* Solution:
  - Use abstraction. Only focus on the important details.
    * e.g. don’t look at entire to-do list. Don’t think about how others will do on the test. Don't think about past tests.
  - Resolve dependencies. Figure out which tasks are doable by themselves. Then perform dependant tasks.
  - Be methodical. As long as you're in a state of flow, you're thinking instead of fearing. Sometimes, you must slow down to more readily work with flow.

## General Advice
* Even though there’s a deadline, that doesn’t mean that you have to think greedily. Think about steps that will set you up for success in the future (having a solid grasp of the fundamentals). Then it’s easy to build on this foundation.
